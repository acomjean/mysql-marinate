1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

The database is the server.  Command are sent to the server via client software (mysql on the command line, phpmyadin or a gui client like sequel pro).  The Mysql server processes the commands and sends replies.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

mysql> help select
Name: 'SELECT'
Description:
Syntax:
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
      [HIGH_PRIORITY]
      [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
      [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
      [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr [, select_expr ...]
    [FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
    [PROCEDURE procedure_name(argument_list)]
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name'
        [CHARACTER SET charset_name]
        export_options
      | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name'
      | INTO var_name [, var_name]]
    [FOR UPDATE | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]]

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/subqueries.html.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using the monitor in batch mode?

interactive mode you type commands in and it processes them.  In batch mode all the commands are in a file and run one after another.  


4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

--user
mysql --user=<my uesrname>  
mysql -u <my uesrname>  
-attempte to connect the mysql server with the username.

--password
mysql --user=<username> --password=<password>

mysql on mac seems to get rid of the password on the command line from the process list.
>ps-ef |grep password
mysql --user=root --password=x xxxx

using just -p Prompts for a password 

--database
using the --database flag automatically sets the databse to the one selected.
mysql --user=root --password=<password> --database=testDB
