2) What are the relative advantages of installing MySQL using the package,
 directory archive (tarball or "no-install"), or compiled methods?

a) pre-configured binary, easier.
b) if you compile it yourself from source,  you end up with  a custom compiled for your system so it will be optimized for your system. 
but its more difficult.  

3) How do you verify the integrity of downloaded packages?

md5.  
from the command line type md5 <filename>.  Match number with string from website. 

4) How do you add the MySQL bin directory to the operating system path?

os-x 10.6

as root
cd /etc/paths.d
touch mysql
edit file mysql and add path to file
so file will contain just: /usr/local/mysql/bin


Additional Exercises (not in the book):

 (The goal is to be easy to install it again on a similar machine.)

a) side-grade to oracle login in from mysql ab

c) download DMG archive
d) check md5
e) mount DMG file system
